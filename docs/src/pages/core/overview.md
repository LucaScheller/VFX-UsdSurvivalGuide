# USD Essentials
In our essentials section, we cover the basics of USD from a software developer perspective.

That means we go over the most common base classes we'll interacting with in our day-to-day work.

Our approach is to start by looking at the smallest elements in USD and increasing complexity until we talk about how different broader aspects/concepts of USD work together.

That does mean we do **not** provide a high level overview. As mentioned in our [motivation](../introduction/motivation.md) section, this guide is conceptualized to be an onboarding guide for developers. We therefore take a very code heavy and deep dive approach from the get-go.

Don't be scared though! We try to stay as "generic" as possible, avoiding USD's own terminology where possible.

Are you ready to dive into the wonderful world of USD? Then let's get started!
