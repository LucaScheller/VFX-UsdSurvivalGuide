# Plugin System
Usd has a plugin system over which individual components are loaded.

~~~admonish Abstract title="Usd Pipeline Plugins"
In this guide we will cover how to create these minimal set of plugins needed to setup a production ready Usd pipeline:
- **Kinds Plugin** (No compiling needed): For this plugin all you need is a simple .json file that adds custom kinds. Head over to our [kind](./kind.md) section to get started.
- **Asset Resolver Plugin** (Compiling needed or use pre-packed resolvers): Head over to our [asset resolver](./assetresolver.md) section to get started. The actual [code](https://github.com/LucaScheller/VFX-UsdAssetResolver) and [guide](https://lucascheller.github.io/VFX-UsdAssetResolver/) is hosted here as it is a big enough topic of its own.
- **Schema Plugin** (Optional, compiling needed if you want Python C++/Bindings): A schema plugin allows you to create own prim types/API schemas. This is useful when you need to often create a standardized set of attributes on prims that are relevant for your pipeline. Head over to our [schemas](./schemas.md) section to get going or to our [schemas overview](../elements/schemas.md) section to get an overview of what schemas are.
- **Metadata Plugin** (Optional, No compiling needed): A metadata plugin allows you to create own metadata entries, so that you don't have to use the `assetInfo`/`customData` dict fields for transporting custom metadata. Schema plugins can also specify metadata, it is limited to the prim/applied schema though, so a standalone metadata plugin allows us to make metadata available on all prims/properties regardless of prim type/schema.

~~~admonish important title="Compiling against USD"
As listed above, some plugins need to be compiled. Most DCCs ship with a customized USD build, where most vendors adhere to the [VFX Reference Platform](https://vfxplatform.com/) and only change USD with major version software releases. They do backport important production patches though from time to time. That's why we recommend using the USD build from the DCC instead of trying to self compile and link it to the DCC, as this guarantees the most stability. This does mean though, that you have to compile all plugins against each (major version) releases of each individual DCC.

Typical plugins are:
- Schemas
- Metadata
- Kinds
- Asset Resolver
- Hydra Delegates (Render Delegates)
- File Format Plugins (.abc/.vdb)

You can inspect if whats plugins were registered by setting the `TF_DEBUG` variable as mentioned in the [debugging](../profiling/debug.md) section:
```bash
export TF_DEBUG=PLUG_REGISTRATION
```

If you want to check via Python, you have to know under what registry the plugin is installed. There are several (info shamelessly copied from the below linked USD-CookBook page ;)):
- KindRegistry
- PlugRegistry
- Sdf_FileFormatRegistry
- ShaderResourceRegistry
- UsdImagingAdapterRegistry

Colin Kennedy's USD-Cookbook has an excellent overview on this topic:
[USD Cook-Book Plugins](https://github.com/ColinKennedy/USD-Cookbook/blob/33eac067a0a62578934105b19a2b9d8e4ea0646c/references/working_with_plugins.md)

Plugins are detected by looking at the `PXR_PLUGINPATH_NAME` environment variable for folders containing a`plugInfo.json` file.

To set it temporarily, you can run the following in a shell and then run your Usd application:
```
// Linux
export PXR_PLUGINPATH_NAME=/my/cool/plugin/resources:${PXR_PLUGINPATH_NAME}
// Windows
set PXR_PLUGINPATH_NAME=/my/cool/plugin/resources:${PXR_PLUGINPATH_NAME}
```

If you search your Usd installation, you'll find a few of these for different components of Usd. They are usually placed in a <Plugin Root>/resources folder as a common directory convention.

Via Python you can also partially search for plugins (depending on what registry they are in) and also print their plugInfo.json file content via the `.metadata` attribute.

~~~admonish info title=""
```python
{{#include ../../../../../code/core/elements.py:pluginsRegistry}}
```

We can also use the plugin registry to lookup from what plugin a specific type/class (in this case a schema) is registered by:
~~~admonish info title=""
```python
{{#include ../../../../../code/core/elements.py:schemasPluginRegistry}}
```
