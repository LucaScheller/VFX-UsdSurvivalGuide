# Debugging
The Usd API ships with a [debug class](https://openusd.org/dev/api/class_tf_debug.html), which allows you to log different messages by setting the `TF_DEBUG` environment variable to one of the symbols. This is useful to see if plugins are loaded or to see if the asset resolver is correctly hooked in.

## TL;DR - Debug In-A-Nutshell
- You can set the `TF_DEBUG` environment variable to one the the values listed below or symbol name from a plugin.
- You can also activate a symbol in the active session via Python: ```pxr.Tf.Debug.SetDebugSymbolsByName("AR_RESOLVER_INIT", True)```

## What should I use it for?
~~~admonish tip
Enabling debug symbols, allows you to inspect specific log outputs of Usd. Typical use cases are to check if plugins are loaded correctly or if data is properly being refreshed.

## Overview
Environment Variables:

| Name                  | Value                |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| TF_DEBUG              | 'DEBUG_SYMBOL_NAME'  |
| TF_DEBUG_OUTPUT_FILE  | 'stdout' or 'stderr' |

~~~admonish tip
Activating the log output via bash:
```bash
export TF_DEBUG=AR_RESOLVER_INIT
```
Then launch your app.
~~~
You can also set them interactively in the active session via Python. Wildcarding is allowd to turn on multiple debug symbols in batch.

~~~admonish tip
```python
activated_symbols = pxr.Tf.Debug.SetDebugSymbolsByName("AR_RESOLVER_INIT", True) # Returns: ["AR_RESOLVER_INIT"]
activated_symbols = pxr.Tf.Debug.SetDebugSymbolsByName("AR_*", True)
```
~~~

External plugins (like asset resolvers) often register own debug symbols which you can then use to see exactly what is going on.

To get a list of value `TF_DEBUG`values you can run:
~~~admonish info title=""
```python
{{#include ../../../../code/core/elements.py:debuggingTokens}}
```
