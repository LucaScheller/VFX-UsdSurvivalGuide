# Performance Profiling
For low level profiling Usd ships with the `trace` profiling module.

This is also what a few DCCs (like Houdini) expose to profile Usd writing/rendering.

## TL;DR - Profiling In-A-Nutshell
- The trace module offers easy to attach Python decorators (`@Trace.TraceMethod/TraceFunction`) that you can wrap your functions with to expose them to the profiler.
- You can dump the profiling result to .txt or the GoogleChrome tracing format you can open under [`chrome://tracing`](chrome://tracing). Even if you don't attach custom traces, you'll get extensive profiling stats of the underlying Usd API execution.

## What should I use it for?
~~~admonish tip
If you want to benchmark you Usd stage operations, the profiling module offers a fast and easy way to visualize performance.

- [Trace Details](https://openusd.org/dev/api/trace_page_detail.html)

## Overview
The trace module is made up of two parts:
- `TraceCollector`: A singleton thread-safe recorder of (globale) events.
- `TraceReporter`: Turn event data to meaning full views.

Via the C++ API, you can customize the behavior further, for Python 'only' the global collector is exposed.

### Marking what to trace
First you mark what to trace. You can also mark nothing, you'll still have access to all the default profiling:
~~~admonish info title=""
```python
{{#include ../../../../code/core/elements.py:profilingTraceAttach}}
```
~~~

### Trace collector & reporter
Then you enable the collector during the runtime of what you want to trace and write the result to the disk.
~~~admonish info title=""
```python
{{#include ../../../../code/core/elements.py:profilingTraceCollect}}
```

Here is an example (from the Usd docs) of a report to a .txt file. If you have ever rendered with Houdini this will be similar to when you increase the log levels.

### Measuring time deltas
Usd ships with a simpel stop watch class that offers high precision time deltas.

```python
{{#include ../../../../code/core/elements.py:profilingStopWatch}}
```

### Stage Stats
You can also gather stage stats, this is mainly used to expose statistics for UIs.
~~~admonish info title=""
```python
from pxr import UsdUtils
print(UsdUtils.ComputeUsdStageStats(stage))
# Returns (On stage with a single cube):
{
 'assetCount': 0, 
 'instancedModelCount': 0,
 'modelCount': 0,
 'primary': {'primCounts': {'activePrimCount': 2,
                            'inactivePrimCount': 0,
                            'instanceCount': 0, 
                            'pureOverCount': 0,
                            'totalPrimCount': 2},
 'primCountsByType': {'Cube': 1}}, 
 'prototypeCount': 0,
 'totalInstanceCount': 0,
 'totalPrimCount': 2,
 'usedLayerCount': 10
}
```
