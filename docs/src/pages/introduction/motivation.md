# Motivation
As [USD](https://openusd.org/release/index.html) has been consistently increasing its market share in the recent years, it is definitely a technology to be aware of when working in any industry that uses 3d related data. It is becoming the de facto standard format on how different applications and vendors exchange their data.

You might be thinking:
```admonish question title=""
Oh no another guide! Do we really need this?
```

This guide aims to solve the following 'niche':
- It aims to be an onboarding guide for software developers & pipeline developers so that you can hit the ground running.
- It aims to be practical as opposed to offering a high-level overview. This means you'll find a lot of code examples from actual production scenarios as well as a more hands on approach instead of overviews/terminology explanations. We'll often link to resources you can look into before a certain section to have a better understanding should vocabulary issues arise.
- It aims to soften the steep learning curve that some aspects of USD have by having a look at common production examples so you can have those sweet "aha, that's how it works" moments.  

Basically think of it as a balance of links listed in the below resources section.
```admonish tip
If this is your first time working with Usd, we recommend watching this 20 minute video from Apple:

[Understand USD fundamentals (Frm WWDC 2022)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10129/)

It covers the basic terminology in a very succinct manner.
